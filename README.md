# 🎨 Anime Character Generator (GAN)

A deep learning project that generates high-quality anime-style faces using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Built with PyTorch and trained on thousands of anime face images.

## 🧠 Overview

This project uses a GAN architecture to learn and generate new anime character faces from random noise.
